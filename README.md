# VoiceChatGPT
ChatGPT 3.5 in Python with voice activation capabilities.

The code implements a chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model to generate responses to user questions. 
The chatbot listens to the user's voice input, converts it to text using Google's speech recognition API, and passes it to the OpenAI model for a response. 
The chatbot then converts the response to an audio file and plays it back to the user.
